# Anomaly Detection
https://anomalydetection.streamlit.app/ (Model Deployed on Cloud)

In data analysis, anomaly detection (also referred to as outlier detection and sometimes as novelty detection) is generally understood to be the identification of rare items, events or observations which deviate significantly from the majority of the data and do not conform to a well defined notion of normal behaviour.[1] Such examples may arouse suspicions of being generated by a different mechanism,[2] or appear inconsistent with the remainder of that set of data.[3] <br>(wikipedia.org)

## Data Preparation:

each text format data is merged to create one dataset

## Model Building
Using Isolation forest , detected anomalies in the data

## Saving model
model is saved using joblib library

## Deployment
created web application to detect anomalies when data is uploaded
